        Hey Beasts! ðŸ‘‹ <br />
        Prady here, I bulked from 125 to 160 lbs from the start of TAMS to now
        (September 2023), gaining muscle and strength. I wrote this guide to
        teach how you can do the same. I hope this guide is valuable for you!

        What is bulking
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-6">
        So what is bulking? Bulking is the process of gaining weight over a
        period of time by eating in a calorie surplus. The goal of bulking is to
        put on muscle and gain strength, ideally while not putting on too much
        fat. <br />
        <br />
        When should you bulk? You should bulk if you want to gain muscle and
        strength and are okay with the sacrifice of gaining some fat
        temporarily.

        How to bulk
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-6">
        <span className="text-lg font-semibold">Step 1: </span> Find your
        maintenance calories <br />
        To bulk, you must eat in a calorie surplus (eat more calories than you
        burn). To find out roughly how many calories you burn, we will use a
        TDEE calculator. Enter your age, weight, height, and activity level (I
        use the heavy exercise option), then press calculate.{" "}
      </p>{" "}
      <Image
        src={bulkingImage1Src}

      />
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Caption: My maintenance calories</p>
      <span className="text-lg font-semibold">Step 2: </span> Calculate bulking
      target <br />
      <p className="leading-6">
        After getting your maintenance calories, add 500 to it and you have your
        bulking calories (it would be 3515 in my example). You can add less than
        500 if you don&apos;t want to bulk as aggressively, but add at least
        300. We will aim to eat this many calories while bulking. You should
        also aim to eat around .8 to 1 gram of protein per lb. of body weight.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-lg font-semibold">Step 3: </span> Track your
        calorie intake <br />
        To track roughly how many calories you are eating, we will use an app
        called MyFitnessPal. Create an account and start tracking your calories
        when you are eating. Unfortunately it&apos;s pretty hard to precisely
        track how many calories you are eating, but you can get a feel for it
        after you have been tracking for a while. <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">Week 1-2:</span> Start tracking your
          meals and aim to get within 500 calories of your goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">Week 3 onwards:</span> Track all of
          your meals and aim to get within 100 calories of your goal.
        </p>

      <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4" id="when-to-stop">
        When to Stop Bulking
      </h1>
      <p>
        You should stop bulking when you are no longer comfortable, but
        ultimately when you stop is up to you. I would recommend bulking for at
        least 3 months, the longer the better. Time spent not bulking when you
        know you can is wasted potential. I had to bulk for about a year to gain
        about 30 lbs, and that&apos;s quite fast.
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4" id="what-to-eat">
        What to eat
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-6">
        When bulking you need to be prioritizing healthy, unprocessed foods. A
        dessert every now and then is ok, but you need to hold yourself
        accountable to what you eat.{" "}
        <span className="underline">
          Eat garbage and you will get garbage results
        </span>
        , this is your warning. Calorie dense options like pasta, bread, rice,
        chicken, nuts, etc. help a lot to get your calories in. If you have a
        blender, you can make high calorie shakes that are quick and easy to
        consume.
