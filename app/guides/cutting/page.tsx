        What is Cutting
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-6">
        Cutting refers to a phase in fitness where someone aims to reduce their
        body fat while preserving or even gaining muscle mass. The goal of
        cutting is to look more lean and defined. Cutting often follows a
        “bulking” phase, which is when a person focuses on gaining mass and
        strength.

        How to Start Cutting
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-6">
        <span className="text-lg font-semibold">Step 1: </span> Set Clear Goals{" "}
        <br />
        Setting goals is important for maintaining motivation, and assessing
        your progress. You should be able to specifically define your specific
        fitness goals(think SMART goals), such as the desired body fat
        percentage, weight loss targets, or physique you want to achieve.
        Setting a goal is also important to know when to stop, as being in a
        calorie deficit for too long can result in losing more muscle than you
        want and can slow your metabolism. <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-lg font-semibold">Step 2: </span> Calculate Your
        Maintenance Calories <br />
        To lose weight, you need to be in a calorie deficit, meaning you burn
        more calories than you eat. To find your personal deficit, you must
        determine your daily caloric needs to maintain your current weight. This
        can be done using online calculators or consulting with a nutritionist.
        This calculator is a good place to start. Remember that these
        calculators are an estimate, and don’t factor in your total activity
        level, genetics and personal needs. <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-lg font-semibold">Step 3: </span> Create a Calorie
        Deficit <br />
        To lose weight, you'll need to consume fewer calories than your
        maintenance level. A common starting point is a calorie deficit of
        300-500 calories per day. <br />
        This is a tough step for many people, and there are many tools that can
        help you. Calorie counting apps and even journaling the food you eat in
        a day can help you. Oftentimes people have to retrain their stomachs to
        be satisfied at different fullnesses. Know that it gets easier the
        longer you do it, so it’s mainly a challenge of mental toughness,
        especially at the beginning.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-lg font-semibold">Step 4: </span>
        Prioritize Nutrient-Dense and High-Protein Foods <br />
        To make the calories you consume count, focus on whole, nutrient-dense
        foods like lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and
        healthy fats. Try to limit sugary and processed foods, especially those
        that are high in calories. That being said, don’t cut out all the foods
        you love, or else you will lose motivation! <br />
        You should also ensure that your diet includes enough protein to retain
        the muscle you already have. Aim for around 0.8 to 1 gram(s) of protein
        per pound of body weight. Some protein sources include lean meats, fish,
        tofu, and legumes. If you are relying on plant-based protein, make sure
        you diversify your protein sources, as many vegetarian proteins are
        incomplete on their own.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-lg font-semibold">Step 5: </span> Combine Strength
        Training and Cardio <br />
        Resistance training helps preserve and potentially build muscle while in
        a calorie deficit. This is mainly done through weight training, so if
        you don’t know where to start, come to a BEAST workshop or tag along
        with someone who already knows the basics. <br />
        At the same time, cardiovascular exercises can burn additional calories,
        making it easier to stay in a calorie deficit. Options include exercises
        like walking, jogging, or swimming, but joining a sports team like
        frisbee, basketball and soccer also count. <br />
        The rock climbing wall is a combination of both strength training and
        cardio, so that’s also a fun option.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-lg font-semibold">Step 6: </span>
        Be Patient and Consistent Regularly <br /> assess your progress by
        tracking changes in your weight, body measurements, and or even using a
        piece of clothing as a reference point. Remember that progress isn’t
        always linear, and it’s normal for things to fluctuate over time. Even
        if you have a bad day, week, or month, incorporating just a few more
        healthy habits is considered progress. <br />
        Cutting takes time, so be patient and stay consistent with your diet and
        exercise plan. Be ready to forgive yourself if things don’t go as
        planned, and talk to an exec if you want support. Don’t forget to
        celebrate small achievements along the way!

        UNT is great at offering a lot of low-calorie, high-protein and nutrient
        dense foods, you just have to know what to look for. Here are some of my
        favorite options at Eagle's Landing:
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Bean Bowl (La Mesa): Veggies, black beans, shredded chicken, pico de
        gallo and top with more veggies
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Better Tomato Soup (Leaf): Ask for a scoop of tofu butter masala, top
        with tomato soup and garnish with cilantro
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Grilled Chicken (Smoke House) and Salad: Ask for just the grilled
        chicken, and then head over to the salad bar to make a leafy salad
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Mexican Breakfast (Ave. A and La Mesa): Get just scrambled eggs from
        Ave. A, and then head over to La Mesa to get veggies, black beans,
        cheese and pico de gallo
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Chicken Soup (La Mesa): Ask for just the shredded chicken, and then head
        over to the soup station to add noodles, pho broth and whatever add-ons
        you like
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Get creative with it! You may have to mix and match different items that
        you like, but make sure you always include a protein and veggie. For
        dessert, I like some fruit, but don’t deprive yourself of a cookie if
        you’re really craving it.
      </p>

        When to Stop Cutting
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-6">
        Once you reach your goal, congratulations! It’s important to stop and
        reassess your goals, because you want your body to recover and adapt.
        You also don’t want to spend your entire life on a diet, as it can be
        mentally and physically exhausting. <br /> <br />
        To stop losing weight, you should aim to consume calories equal to your
        maintenance level. If you've been in a significant calorie deficit
        during your cutting phase, it's essential to increase your calorie
        intake gradually to avoid sudden weight gain or metabolic issues. <br />{" "}
        <br />
        This is a warning: If your calorie restriction is too long and extreme,
        your body may adapt to the calorie deficit by slowing down your
        metabolism. This can make it more challenging to continue losing fat and
        could lead to fat loss plateaus. It can also be challenging to sustain
        both mentally, leading to binge eating episodes, as well as an increased
        risk of regaining lost weight when returning to regular eating habits.
        If you are afraid your eating habits have become disordered, please talk
        to a trusted adult and/or a mental health expert.
